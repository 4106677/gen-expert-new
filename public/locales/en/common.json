These sectors require electricity for equipment, heat for heating premises or greenhouses, and hot water for technological processes. Cogeneration systems ensure energy efficiency, reducing costs and promoting sustainable development. For example, dairy farms can use heat for milk pasteurization, while crop farms can use CO₂ to boost yields. Using biogas from waste enables energy independence, which is especially critical for remote rural areas.",
